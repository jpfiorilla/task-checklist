This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Decisions

I took a pretty standard approach to this project. I started with the schema for a Task. Once I had that, both creating the form for creating data, and the list for displaying data, were straightforward.

AI tools supported my workflow in several ways. ChatGPT proved to be a fast and useful resource for docs-style questions; from implementing package boilerplates to the most idiomatic way of utilizing those packages' APIs. I was able to ask it naunced questions to determine the precise right approach for each decision. Generally I would provide it with clips of my existing code, and I would paste bits and pieces in manually in order to make any suggested implementations thoughtfully and defensively.
